# SF2EDITPOC
Personnal attempt at updating Space King's SF2Edit, in order to make it compatible with split disassemblies.
Original SF2Edit version is 16a from 08/05/2013. Main goal is to adapt SF2Edit to make it work on split disassemblies with SF2 data format. Will be shared with Space King as soon as a Proof-of-Concept is available and convincing enough to discuss about SF2Edit's future.
