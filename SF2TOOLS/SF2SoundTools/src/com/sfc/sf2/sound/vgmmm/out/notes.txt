YM commands : 



FC xx		Set Key Release or Pitch Slides :
		- if xx < 80, release notes key at (note length - xx)
		- if xx = 80, key is never released, even between different notes.
ECx - Note cut 
Generates Key Off event on x frame of the current row. 
Zero x value or a value greater than the number of frames in a row will be ignored. 
The effect works only for a row. 
The effect also could be used without a note, this causes to currently playing note being cut. 

Found => release position = current position + x - 1
	- determine note length
	- apply release length-position before current note
	- after note, apply no release
		
		- if 80<xx<FF, make slides between notes. xx bits 6-0 = slide speed. The higher the value, the quicker the slide.
		- if xx = FF, stop pitch slides.
3xx - Porta to note 
Slide pitch from previous note to the new one, which specified at the same line with the effect. 
Value xx defines speed of the pitch change and measured in 32th of semitone per frame. 
Zero xx value could be used to repeat previously used value for this effect. 

Found =>
		- apply "key never released" before current note
		- define current note length
		- apply slide with ((speed/2) || 0x80)
		- apply target note
		- apply release 0
		- apply vibrato 0
		
		

FB xy		Load Vibrato x, triggered at Note Length 2*y
4xy - Vibrato 
Sine vibrato, changes pitch up and down with specified depth and speed. Value x defines speed of the vibrato. 
Zero means no vibrato, 1 is minimal speed, F is maximum. Value y defines depth of the vibrato and measured in 16th of semitone. 
Maximum depth is about whole note (semitone up and down from the base note). When the effect ends, normal pitch is restored. 
Zero values of xy could be used to repeat previously used value for this effect (separate for x and y). 

Found with note => applied before note.
Found without note => 
	if current note not further than length 30, apply before current note
	else, 	- apply "key never released" before current note
		- define current note length
		- apply vibrato
		- apply identical note
		- apply release 0
		- apply vibrato 0

Cube vibrato 0 : no vibrato
1 : -$10 -$10 +$10 +$10
2 :   -3   -3   -1   +1   +3   +3   +3   +1   -1   -3

5 :   -1    0    0   +1    0   +1    0    0   -1    0
Mostly used : 2 with y=$C or 0.
For PSG : 4







FA xx		Set Stereo :
		- xx bit 7 : 1 for LEFT output ON, 0 for OFF
		- xx bit 6 : 1 for RIGHT output ON, 0 for OFF
E8x - Pan (YM2612 only) 
Effect does not work on the TFM device and is not audible in the editor. Allows to use YM2612 pan control. 
Pan has three fixed settings - left (x value is 1), right (x value is 2) or center (any other value). 

Found => applied before note 



F0 xx		Set Note Length xx and Play Silence for that length

70		Play Silence for Note Length
